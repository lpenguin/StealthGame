This is a simple stealth-based game which uses Stateorio in enemy AI. It is for demonstration only. 
You don't need any of the files in Stateorio/Example subfolder in order to use Stateorio.

Controls:
Arrows/WASD: Move
Left mouse button: Kill enemies
Move mouse to turn around

There are three enemies patrolling the level. If they see you they will chase you 
and try to kill you. You can shoot them down with left mouse button.

The enemy AI is modeled as an FSM. It has five states:
 - EnemyPatrolling
 - EnemyChasing
 - EnemyAttacking
 - EnemyAlerted
 - EnemyDying

There are three conditions for controlling state transitions:
 - SeesPlayer
 - PlayerInRange
 - Killed

All of these components are commented to explain what they do. I suggest going through the code to get a general idea.

Following are all of the state transitions.

GlobalState:
 -> EnemyDying IF Killed

EnemyPatrolling:
 -> EnemyChasing IF SeesPlayer

EnemyChasing:
 -> EnemyAlerted IF NOT SeesPlayer
 -> EnemyAttacking IF PlayerInRange

EnemyAttacking:
 -> EnemyAlerted IF NOT SeesPlayer
 -> EnemyChasing If NOT PlayerInRange

EnemyAlerted:
 -> EnemyChasing IF SeesPlayer
 -> EnemyPatrolling (programmatically)

EnemyDying:
 * no transitions *
